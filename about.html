						<h3>Accessible Research</h3>
						<p>
							At <span class="companyname"></span>, our focus is on developing devices for research. But we are also driven by another goal: We want to make these devices accessible to the general public. Why? By sharing our designs and technologies publicly, we increase the distribution and use of our products. By increasing our user base, we can develop more cost-effective solutions without compromising the accuracy and quality of our devices.<br>
							Our approach is to no longer reserve research instruments for a limited group of experts. Instead, we want to make research instruments more affordable and more widely available so that they can be used by a diverse community of scientists, researchers and enthusiasts. We believe that fostering openness and collaboration will enable us to produce innovative solutions that have a positive impact on society as a whole.

						<h3>Open-Source Approach</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="companyname"></span> is proud to be an open source company. We believe that the freedom to share knowledge and technology accelerates progress and inspires creativity. By making our designs open, we enable others to design and manufacture our devices locally. This approach has several benefits at once.<br>
							First, the open source philosophy promotes local independence. By allowing research instruments to be developed and produced locally, we reduce dependence on outside suppliers or expensive imports. This facilitates access to important tools and strengthens research capabilities in different regions.<br>
							Second, we create a transparent and trusting community through openness. By being able to view the source code and development processes, users can verify the integrity and safety of the devices. This fosters trust in our products and enables the community to troubleshoot and collaborate on improvements.
