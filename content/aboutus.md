#### Hey,
my name is Mirko HÃ¤berlin and I love to create Hardware with the intention to make it real products </br>and not only plain PCB's. 
I want to give them a purpose, a use-case and at the end as well a nice look. </br> I have a training as technical assistant for medical devices 
and also a Bc.S in mediainformatics. In my </br>last job I became hardware engineer where I combined both educations to create products from scratch.

Now I started my own business and try to be sustainable with my own ideas.

using other sensors and combining all informations to make them switch on  -->
